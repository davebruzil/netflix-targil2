# üé¨ Netflix Clone - Team Project

## üìã Mission
Build a full-stack Netflix clone with user authentication, personalized profiles, content management, and smart recommendations. The app uses MongoDB Atlas for cloud database storage, Express.js backend with secure session-based authentication, and a responsive frontend.

## üîÑ Recent Changes (MongoDB Migration)
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete

The application has been **fully migrated from JSON file storage to MongoDB Atlas**:

- **Database**: All data now stored in cloud MongoDB (users, profiles, content, sessions, activity logs)
- **Authentication**: Implemented bcrypt password encryption with strong validation rules
- **Sessions**: MongoDB-backed session management with 24-hour secure cookies
- **Security**: Added request logging, rate limiting (5 login attempts/15 min), and protected routes
- **Middleware**: Authentication middleware protects all profile and content operations

**What works now**:
- ‚úÖ User registration with encrypted passwords
- ‚úÖ User login with session creation
- ‚úÖ Profile creation (up to 5 per user)
- ‚úÖ All data persisted in MongoDB Atlas
- ‚úÖ Request logging to database
- ‚úÖ Protected API routes
