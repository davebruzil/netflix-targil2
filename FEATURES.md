# Netflix Clone - Features Implementation Summary

## Recent Features Implemented

### 1. Episode Memory System for TV Series
**Implementation Date:** Recent

#### Overview
A comprehensive episode tracking system that remembers which episode users were watching and automatically resumes from that exact point.

#### Features
- **Episode Storage**: Stores episode number, season number, and episode title in the database alongside watch progress
- **Smart Resume**: When users return to a TV show, the system automatically:
  - Resumes at the saved episode
  - Displays episode info in the Continue button (e.g., "Continue S1E2")
  - Restores the exact timestamp within that episode
- **Database Schema**: Extended `ProfileSchema.watchHistory` with three new fields:
  - `episodeNumber` (Number, nullable)
  - `seasonNumber` (Number, nullable)
  - `episodeTitle` (String, nullable)

#### Technical Implementation
**Backend:**
- `backend/schemas/ProfileSchema.js`: Added episode fields to watch history
- `backend/controllers/ProfileController.js`: Updated to accept episode parameters
- `backend/models/Profile.js`: Modified `saveWatchProgress()` to store episode data

**Frontend:**
- `frontend/js/player.js`:
  - Sends episode info when saving progress for TV shows
  - Finds and resumes at saved episode on page load
  - Resets progress bar when switching episodes
- `frontend/js/movie-profile.js`:
  - Loads episode information from watch history
  - Displays episode number in Continue button

#### User Experience
1. User watches Episode 2 of a TV show
2. User closes the player
3. User returns to the show's profile page
4. Continue button shows "Continue S1E2"
5. Clicking Continue resumes Episode 2 at the exact timestamp

- New episode auto-plays after switching
- Works with both mock playback and real video files

#### Technical Implementation
**File Modified:** `frontend/js/player.js`

**Changes in `playEpisode()` method:**
```javascript
// Reset progress bar to 0 for new episode
this.mockCurrentTime = 0;
this.progressFill.style.width = '0%';
this.progressHandle.style.left = '0%';
